Born in 4976u to mercenary parents, Alex was raised aboard nearlight ships before being dropped off at a MSMC-owned school. There, they learned all about the world and graduated at the top of their class, entering a prestigious law college on Cradle. Once they graduated there, they began their contract with MSMC to repay for their schooling. This is the last year they need to work for MSMC but the first time they are being deployed with a combat team. The MSMC NHPs flagged Hercynia as a high risk world, and as such assigned a front-line combat lawyer to the responce team. Despite this, Alex is not expecting much in the way of combat and is prepared to wait out their last year with the company on a sleepy colony world and then move onto greater things in the metropolitian systems.
