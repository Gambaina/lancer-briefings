Aylssa is a known enigma for some in higher circles around the Galaxy. She is known as a fixer of problems and a above average retriever of data. In her past life she did anything from gaining military intel too corporate espionage. Anything a solo hacker can do to earn quick good money.
Appearance wise she seems to be in her early 30's but no one is quite sure. Another mystery is how her name ended up in the MSMC database. She does have contacts with MSMC before her sudden interest in becoming a Mech Pilot. One thing is known that she has installed an Unclassified NHP onto her Mech. She has been whispering to herself since answering the emergency contract as well as other strange behaviours. She has so far refused to attend a psychiatric assessment. Offer in still pending.
