# Mission // #001
## Gambaina fucking did it
# Goals
- Damn this is poggers.
- Track the raiders, figure out who they are.
  - Continue the Attacks.

# Stakes
- Time is critical. Not acting will result in Evergreen losing contact with surrounding farmland, crippling any kind of expansion.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
