# Situation

Yesterday at exactly *0700* our 72 Scout Drone was destroyed in a cave located in the 74th mapped sector of our secured zone. Footage reveals that the cave now contains a large colony. This is an imminent threat to our outpost and we are requesting a Lancer team be sent immediatly to aid us in the protection of our walls and the orbital targeting of the colony. We will be providing the cavefinder, transport and markers for this operation but request use of one of the orbital rails as a BBI round will be required.


# Plan & Objectives

The Lancer team you send will first have to clear any remaining forces from our bases perimiter to ensure that the operation goes undisturbed. Once completed we will transport them by air to the rough location above the caves primary chasm, from there they will need to locate and mark thinnest point above the cave to ensure the BBI round deals as much damage to the hive as possible. This will need to be completed in constrained time as it is likely that hive forces will respond quickly to Lancer presence.
